### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm an Honors Computer Science student with a deep passion for Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has been enriched by rigorous coursework in Data Structures, Algorithms, Application Development, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Digital Design, Computer Systems & Networks, Statistics & Probability, Calculus, and Computing Ethics.

At NVIDIA, I served as a High Performance Computing and Deep Learning Performance Engineer Intern, where I led GPU performance benchmarking across various HPC and Deep Learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA. I developed automation frameworks, conducted performance analyses on supercomputing clusters with Linux and SLURM, and optimized GPU-based applications in collaboration with cross-functional teams.

In my research endeavors, I led a project focused on prompt engineering for Large Language Models, analyzing how prompt techniques influence information quality and readability across domains. Additionally, I contributed to computational biology research by optimizing RNA sequencing algorithms in Python and utilizing high-performance computing resources and Jupter notebooks to conduct data analysis and visualization, with results presented at my unviersity's research conference.

I've had the opportunity to lead and develop a diverse array of projects, including a Fitness Tracker Gym App in Java, a Haunted Mansion Mystery VR experience using Unreal Engine 5, and several Python-based projects: an AI-driven Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe game, a Geospatial Neural Network, and a Stock Market Genetic Algorithm. Additionally, I have worked on *CurseBound*, a 2D turn-based RPG in Java, and developed complex C++ applications like a Banking System and a Property Listing Applcation.

My technical skills span C++, Java, Python, and R, along with experience in Linux, Git, Docker, Conda, CUDA, Unreal Engine 5 amongst several others. I'm excited to bring my research background, technical expertise, and project leadership experience to a dynamic team where I can contribute to impactful projects and advance in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.
